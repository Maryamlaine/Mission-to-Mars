# web-scraping
A web application was built after scraping various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars (including NASA Mars News, JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image, Mars Weather,  Mars Facts and Mars Hemispheres). We then used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped.
